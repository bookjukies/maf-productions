<p>
    I am Mafungwase Nxumalo, a photographer based in durban. I shoot weddings, events and portraits .
    I believe that everything we see and surrounds us is practically a memory but my job as a photographer it is to
    preserve
    those memories in a beautiful and artistic way. There is more to photography than knowing how to "just" take a great
    photo but also the ability to capture photos in a way that will tell a thousand stories when you look at them.
</p><br>

<p>Photography is my passion but i still learn as i grow. My clients are my pride and joy. It is always my pleasure to
    work
    with and provide them with great service not only through my work but through my personality as well. It is
    important
    for me to always build a professional trusting relationships with my clients.
    Allow me to tell your story through my lense.</p>
